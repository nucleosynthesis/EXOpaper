\section{CMS detector}

The CMS detector, described in detail in ref.~\cite{CMSdetector}, is a multi-purpose apparatus designed to study high-$\pt$ physics processes in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.  
A superconducting solenoid occupies its central 
region, providing a magnetic field of 3.8\unit{T} parallel to the beam direction. Charged-particle trajectories are measured by the silicon pixel and strip trackers, which 
cover a pseudorapidity region of $\abs{\eta} < 2.5$. A lead tungstate (PbWO$_4$) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL) 
surround the tracking volume and cover $\abs{\eta} < 3$. The steel/quartz-fiber Cherenkov hadron forward (HF) calorimeter extends the coverage to $\abs{\eta} < 5$.  
The muon system consists of gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux return yoke outside the solenoid, and covers $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$. The first level of the 
CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, is designed to select the most interesting events in less than 4\mus, using information from the calorimeters 
and muon detectors. The high-level trigger processor farm then further reduces the event rate to a few hundred Hz.
