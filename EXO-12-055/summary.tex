\section{Summary}
A search has been presented for an excess of events with a high energy jet 
in association with a large missing transverse momentum in a data sample of 
proton-proton interactions at centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data 
correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7\fbinv collected by the CMS 
detector at the LHC. 
This search is the first at CMS to utilise sub-structure techniques in order to identify hadronically decaying vector 
bosons in both boosted and resolved scenarios. The sensitivity to a mono-V signature is enhanced by categorising the events 
according to the origin of the jets in the event as either quark/gluon radiation or from a hadronically decaying vector boson through these techniques.
The sensitivity is further increased by using the full shape of the $\ETm$ distribution to discriminate signal from standard model backgrounds. 
No significant deviation from the expectation from SM backgrounds is observed in the \ETm distributions.  
The results of the search are interpreted under a set of simplified models which describe the production of DM via vector, axial-vector, scalar or pseudoscalar mediation and 
constraints on the parameter space of these simplified models are produced. The search is the first at CMS to be interpreted under these simplified models for 
DM production.
