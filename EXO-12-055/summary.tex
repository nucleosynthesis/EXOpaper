\section{Summary}
A search has been presented for an excess of events with a high energy jet 
in association with a large missing transverse momentum in a data sample of 
proton-proton interactions at centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data 
correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7\fbinv collected by the CMS 
detector at the LHC. Sensitivity to mono-V models is achieved by tagging events 
consistent with the jet originating from a hadronically decaying vector boson. 
No significant deviation from the expectation from SM backgrounds is observed in the \ETm 
distributions.  
The search is interpreted in terms of DM production to place 
constraints on the parameter space of the simplified models considered.
