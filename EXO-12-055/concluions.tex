\section{Conclusions}
A search for dark matter in the mono-jet and mono hadronically decaying vector boson is performed. No significant excesses is observed in either the hadronically decaying vector boson final state nor the mono-jet final state. Results are interpreted  through dark matter production mediated by a pure vector,axial-vector,scalar, and pseudoscalar particle. Bounds are presented in terms of a set of standardized simplfied models.   An exclusion of an (axial) vector mediator is found up to the range of 1.7\TeV, a scalar mediator up to 100\GeV, and a pseudo-scalar mediator up to 400 GeV. These bounds extend the exclusion of dark matter beyond direct and indirect detection bounds for low mass dark matter particles. In particular, the pseudoscalar bounds strongly exclude the recent bounds by FermiLAT and do not confirm an observed excesses as dark matter.

Through the use of a shape analysis, simplified models, and additional control regions, these results have extended the search for dark matter at the LHC substantially.  Currently, they are the most sensitive collider bounds for dark matter in the jet and \MET final final state.
