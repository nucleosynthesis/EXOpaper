% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
A search is presented for an excess of events with a large missing transverse momentum in association with a highly energetic jet in a data sample of proton-proton 
interactions at centre-of-mass energy of 8TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected by the CMS detector at the LHC.
Additional sensitivity is achieved by tagging events consistent with the jet originating from a boosted hadronically decaying vector boson.   
The results are interpreted in the context of a set of simplified models for the production of dark matter.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
